# Server Bootstrapping with Ansible
**Save time** and **set up servers quickly** with your preferred configuration, out of the box.  
These Ansible playbooks provide a streamlined way to get Ubuntu, RedHat, and CentOS servers ready for production or development.

## Why Use It?

- **Time-Saving**: Apply your standard setup in minutes.
- **Consistency**: All servers get the same baseline configuration.
- **Convenience**: No more manual steps to create users, set DNS, configure firewalls, etc.

For per-distro instructions, see:

- [redhat/README.md](redhat_centos/README.md)
